This is an ongoing backend API application for the Expense Tracker project, currently being built using Go and following [Clean Architecture principles](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html). The project is designed to utilize MySQL, Redis, Amazon S3, ECS, and API Gateway to provide a robust and scalable backend service. A corresponding [frontend project](https://github.com/eyo-chen/expense-tracker) is also in development.
